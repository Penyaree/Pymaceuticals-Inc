# Pymaceuticals-Inc
Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications.
Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.
In this animal study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured
The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.
## Result analysis
In this animal study, 249 mice (male=51% and female=49%) who were identified with SCC tumors were treated with 10 regimens with 45 days observation. Capomulin and Ramican were the biggest treatment group and Propriva was the smallest treatment group.
After 45 days of treatment, the final tumor volume (mm3) with the Capomulin and Ramicane groups was smaller than with Infubinol and Ceftamin groups.
In the Capomulin group, the drug's effectiveness was high.
The correlation between mouse weight and the average tumor volume was 0.84, showing that lower mouse weight correlated with smaller tumor volume.
